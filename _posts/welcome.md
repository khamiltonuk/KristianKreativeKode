I don't like saying what I am good at, it makes me uncomfortable, I am aware this makes for a terrible salary negotiations, crippling modesty will prevent me from listing too many things but one thing I do think I am good at is mentoring/coaching, so much so I do it in my spare time, I actually enjoy it. I have been making websites with varying degrees of success for over a decade and I have learnt many things along the way which I am happy to share with others.

I enjoy helping people understand complex stuff. I see it as my responsibility to be able to effectively explain a concept, if I can't explain what's going on then I clearly don't understand the topic, stripping away jargon and using analogies to convey a topics feels amazing when the other person has an "aha" moment. I have had positive professional feedback, and informal feedback about this skill many times. I like to see it as a compassionate way to teach, I mostly did teaching in the past through a charity organisation called [codebar](https://codebar.io/) once every two weeks to under-represented groups in tech.

We have a coaching guide at codebar, which we give to first time coaches, but will often point seasoned coaches to it just as a reminder, one of the many points is "Assume that anyone you're teaching has no knowledge but infinite intelligence." It's my favourite recommendation. I constantly to remind myself of this, just because it feels like the right thing to do when teaching something, especially when the concept is hard.

I would say that the explaining concepts is the easy part. What I spend a lot of time doing is encouraging people to "throw their hat in a ring", making sure the person applies for that job even if they fit all the points on the job spec. Avoiding rejection by not putting yourself forward and self censoring can causes missed opportunities. I need to take my own advice, This is something I too have been doing, I have never had a blog because I felt I had nothing useful to say, I struggle with spelling and there are so many people better than me writing about stuff online.

I am still committed to codebar, but I am increasing just helping friends in my spare time which doesn't scale well, hopefully this blog can reach more people.

I am gonna give it a go, not sure 100% what I will talk about, it will most likely be web technologies, and other stuff I find interesting.
